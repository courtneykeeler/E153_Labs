* Can see the sin wave moving across the screen but cannot capture samples and therefore cannot measure signal

** Can't be measured since time scale minimum is .4us/div while storing is on
\\[.1in]
Table \ref{table:SinWave} shows that the analog scope is favored for high frequency measurements, while the digital scope is favored for low frequency measurements. This is due to the fact that the analog oscilloscope cannot store past values, so at low frequencies, the oscilloscope displays a continuously moving signal. For a higher frequency signal, this is not an issue because the movement of the signal on the screen cannot be perceived by the human eye and appears static (and can therefore be measured). The digital oscilloscope can store past data points and therefore display a measurable signal at very low frequencies. However, the time required to perform an A/D conversion and store the value limits the upper frequency at which the digital oscilloscope can operate. While this setting stills displays data for a 10MHz signal, the user is unable to zoom far enough in on the screen to measure the frequency of the signal seen.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Calculations}
The resistive and reactive loading are found by circuit analysis. For the BNC cable, the circuit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bnc_circuit}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, keepaspectratio=true]{lab1_images/BNC_circuit.png} 
	\caption{Circuit model of a BNC cable connecting a function generator (with an additional 10k resistor in between) to an oscilloscope}
	\label{fig:bnc_circuit}
\end{figure}

We can see that the only resistive element is the 1M$\Omega$ resistor, so this resistance value becomes the resistive loading of the circuit. The circuit of the 10X probe is shown in Figure \ref{fig:probe_circuit}.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, keepaspectratio=true]{lab1_images/10x_circuit.png} 
	\caption{Circuit model of a 10x probe connecting a function generator (with an additional 10k resistor in between) to an oscilloscope}
	\label{fig:probe_circuit}
\end{figure}
 
Here we see that there are two resistive elements in series. The total resistive loading of this circuit becomes the sum of the two resistance values: 10M$\Omega$. These results are summarized in Table \ref{table:ResistiveLoading}.

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Resistive Loading} % title of Table
\centering 
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
	\hline

	1 M$\Omega $ & 10 M$\Omega$ \\

	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:ResistiveLoading}
\end{table}
\end{center}

To calculate the reactive loading of the BNC and 10X probe circuits, we analyze the capacitors only (if these circuits included inductors, they would be analyzed here too). For the BNC model, Figure \ref{fig:bnc_circuit} shows two capacitors in parallel. To find the total reactive loading, we add their values and find the impedance (Z) of the combined capacitance:
$$ \text{C}_{\text{total}} = 108 \text{pF} + 20 \text{pF} = 128 \text{pF} $$
$$ \text{Z} = \frac{1}{\text{j}\omega\text{C}_{\text{total}}} $$
The $\omega$ term refers to signal frequency, and we must evaluate for 100 Hz, 1kHz, and 1MHz. The results are summarized in Table \ref{table:ReactiveLoading}.

For the 10x probe model, Figure \ref{fig:probe_circuit} shows the only reactive elements are three capacitors - one in series with two in parallel. The total capacitance of these three capacitors is
$$ \text{C}_{\text{total}} = \frac{18 \text{pF} (53 \text{pF} + 20 \text{pF})}{18 \text{pF} + 53 \text{pF} + 20 \text{pF}} = 14 \text{pF} $$

 
\begin{center}
\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Reactive Loading}
\centering
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
	\hline	
	Frequency & BNC & 10X Probe \\
	\hline
	100 Hz & 12.4 M$\Omega$ & 110 M$\Omega$\\
	1000 Hz & 1.24 M$\Omega$ & 11.0 M$\Omega$\\
	1 MHz & 1.24 k$\Omega$ & 11.0 k$\Omega$\\	
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:ReactiveLoading}
\end{table}
\end{center}

Note that for the 10x probe, the reactive and resistive loading magnitudes are equivalent at

$$ \frac{1}{2 \pi f\text{C}_{\text{total}}} = 9 M\Omega \Rightarrow f = 1.22 kHz $$.

\section*{Section B.2: The 10X Scope Probe}
\subsection*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Connect the function generator to the bread board using a BNC cable and splitter
	\item Put a 10k$\Omega$ resisistor in series with the generator output
	\item Connect a BNC cable from the resistor to the oscilloscope
	\item Turn the function generator on and output a sine wave
	\item Increase the frequency until the magnitude measured by the scope is 0.707 times that coming from the function generator (1 $\text{V}_{\text{pp}}$)
	\item Record that frequency (which is the corner frequency)
	\item Repeat the steps 3-5 for a 10x probe
	\item Build the circuit models in ModelSim and run the simulation tool to verify the measured corner frequencies
	\item Use MATLAB to estimate what a square wave and triangle wave would look like through each circuit at the corner frequency and 10x the corner frequency
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Results}

	\caption{Oscilloscope reading at corner frequency (1.15 MHz) for 10x probe in series with a 10k resistor. }
	\label{fig:probe_corner}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:bnc_circuit} shows the model used for the BNC circuit (a low pass filter), and Figure \ref{fig:bnc_corner} shows the oscilloscope reading at the corner frequency (135 kHz). Similarly, Figure \ref{fig:probe_circuit} shows the model for the 10x probe circuit, and Figure \ref{fig:probe_corner} shows the scope reading at the corner frequency (1.15 MHz).

	\label{fig:probe_bode}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:bnc_bode} and \ref{fig:probe_bode} show the bode plots, produced by MultiSim, for the BNC circuit and the 10x scope circuit respectively. Figures \ref{fig:bnc_circuit} and \ref{fig:probe_circuit} show the MultiSim circuits which correspond to these bode plots. Table \ref{table:corners} summarizes the expected and measured corner frequencies for the two circuits.

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Corner Frequencies (expected and estimated)}

	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
	\hline
	& \textbf{BNC/Coax} & \textbf{10X Probe} \\

	\textbf{Expected} & 122 kHz & 1.09 MHz \\
	\textbf{Measured} & 135 kHz & 1.15 MHz \\
	\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{table:corners}
\end{table}
\end{center}

The measured corner frequencies for the BNC and 10x probe circuits are 10\% and 6\% greater than expected respectively. These differences can be partially attributed to the fact that our model does not take the connecting cable between the function generator and bread board into account, which has a non-neglible capacitance. Similarly, the BNC splitters used to connect components of the circuit also have a non-zero capacitance that would affect the measured corner frequency.
